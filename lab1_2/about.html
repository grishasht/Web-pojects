					<p>&nbsp Edward of Westminster (13 October 1453 â€“ 4 May 1471), also known 
			as Edward of Lancaster, was the only son of King Henry VI of 
			England and Margaret of Anjou. He was killed at the Battle of Tewkesbury, 
			making him the only heir apparent to the English throne to die in battle.
			Edward was born at the Palace of Westminster, London, the only son of King
			Henry VI of England and his wife, Margaret of Anjou. At the time, there
			was strife between Henry's supporters and those of Richard Plantagenet, 
			3rd Duke of York, who had a claim to the throne and challenged the 
			authority of Henry's officers of state. Henry was suffering from mental
			illness, and there were widespread rumours that the prince was the result
			of an affair between his mother and one of her loyal supporters. Edmund 
			Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset and James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormonde, were
			both suspected of fathering Prince Edward; however, there is no firm
			evidence to support the rumours, and Henry himself never doubted the boy's
			legitimacy and publicly acknowledged paternity. Edward was invested as 
			Prince of Wales at Windsor Castle in 1454.</p>
